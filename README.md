# cinema-database
Database for cinema is a project made as a part of the "Databases" course at the Jagiellonian University.
This project features database with its data, procedures, functions and triggers. 

The main objective of this project was to allow the generation of income/expense raports for time intervals or selected movies.
This database gathers essential data for a cinema to function, such as having showing-specific data, keeping track of employee shifts,
list of clients, movies, maintaining control of reservations and having transaction history.
